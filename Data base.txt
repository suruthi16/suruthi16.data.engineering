Database:

Database is a collection of data(any form). Database is used to organise the data to use with ease. DBMS is used to update, delete, add, etc. in a database.
Types of database:
1. Relational database: used to read and write to database with SQL
2. No SQL (eg: MongDB): more disorganise, but allows to maintain a large amount of data in different computers
3. New SQL

Relational DB:
This type of database consist of two or more tables with rows and columns. Schema must be clearly described in Relational DB. It uses SQL
eg: Postgre Sql

No SQL/ Non-relational DB:
It is used when, data requirements are not clearly defined, and when there is massive amount of data.
eg: Mongo DB - document oriented database.

Hadoop:
** Open source
** distributed processing framework
** It allows to do data processing and storage for big data. Used to store a large amount of data.
** It is like data lake

HDFS:
** Hadoop distributed file system
** It allows to store files on multiple computers, so data is stored across different countries in different computers.

Map reduce:
** Do batch processing to clean and process the data in data lake, to make it useful for companies.

Apache spark:
** Run processing job, much faster than the map reduce, used to run ETL jobs, clean and process data.

Apache Flink:
** Offer real time streaming data.

Kalfa and stream processing:
** Distributed streaming platform
** Kalfa is a message broker
** Allow pass the data for realtime process and batch process
